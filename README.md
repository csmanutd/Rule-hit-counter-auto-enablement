# Rule-hit-counter API enablement automation
This tool will help you enable PCE Rule hit counter feature automatically without calling APIs manually.

For the 1st time run, it will ask for API key/secret and save all the info in the json file.

If Rule hit counter is already enabled, nothing will be updated.
